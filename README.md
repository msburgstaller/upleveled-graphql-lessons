## Who are you?

One-two sentence each

## Data fetching & APIs

### What did you do so far?

Data fetching via HTTP

Why? We are storing and interacting with data. We want to retrieve it and store it on the server (so we can access it not only on one client - think about Twitter, but without Tweets of your friends).

- Different methodologies
- APIs can be use-case oriented, (rather) generic or both
- Other API methodologies: SOAP, RPC, CORBA, Queue based, ...
- REST: commonly entity based data fetching over HTTP
  - Attention: RESTful APIs are very flexible, there's not "the way" to design a REST API
  - Mostly based on HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
  - Can be classified in a maturity model (e.g. it's still a REST API with just a GET endpoint)
  - See https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#Richardson_Maturity_Model for details

## GraphQL

- Initiated by Facebook
- Docs: https://graphql.org
- Flexible, generic way to interact with data.
- Can be served over HTTP
  - Then related to REST in the maturity model as Level 0
  - Usually uses one endpoint `/graphql` when served over HTTP
- Schema & Query based
- Just ask for the data you need based on the schema you got
- Strict separation between querying and mutating data
- Also defines subscriptions for real-time interaction
- Sometimes integral part of other tools, then not always served over HTTP, i.e.
  - Prisma uses GraphQL Schemas for database definition
  - Gatsby uses GraphQL as a query language

# Exercise

_Hint_: Using CTRL + Space you can autocomplete fields in the GraphQL IDE.

1. Use the StarWars GraphQL API `https://graphql.github.io/swapi-graphql/` to query:

_Hint_: The schema has some duplications of data e.g. people & edges.node contain the same data. Nik will explain why so!

- Query all People
- Query the names of all Starships related to Luke Skywalker!

_Hint_: Get Luke by his id, which you can get from `allPeople`.

- Query the population and all the residents on the planet Naboo.

2. Use the Github GraphQL API `https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/` (embded GraphiQL) to query

- Your repositories (first 10)
- Extend the query to show the default branch of each repository

Other public APIs to play around with https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-apis

## Query data

- We're going to use Apollo GraphQL's libraries and tools going forward
  - Most widely used in the GraphQL space
  - Fairly stable
  - Broad community
- There are others, too (e.g. Relay from Facebook)

Create new app with `yarn create react-app app` and go through
https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/

## Make use of GraphQL

Build you own Profile page based on Github e.g. https://github.com/msburgstaller using the Github GraphQL Endpoint

- Show your name
- Show your Github Avatar
- Show a list of (public) repositories

1. Generate an access token:
   https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

_Hint_: You can use the `boilerplate` provided in this repository as a starter.

_Hint_:

- `yarn add @apollo/client graphql`

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://api.github.com/graphql",
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  headers: {
    authorization: "Bearer TODO",
  },
});
```

```jsx
<ApolloProvider client={client}>â€¦</ApolloProvider>
```

```jsx
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

const profileQuery = gql`
  TODO YOUR QUERY
`;

export default function Profile(props) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(profileQuery);

  return null; // TOOD render your component
}
```

## Using Variables

Make the username dynamic and allow to fetch the profile based on the url.

When visiting the `profile/:username` route use the route to fetch data for only the one specific route.

_Hint_: Fetch one place first with a hard coded ID to see if it works and then extend it to use GraphQL variables for the profile username to always fetch the correct profile.

_Hint_:

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(placeQuery, { variables: {} });
```
